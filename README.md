### 🏥 Applied Capstone – *MIMIC-CDS*

[**Explore the Project**](https://github.com/sobcza11/mimiccds)

A modular Clinical Decision Support (CDS) platform designed to simulate ICU decision-making using **real de-identified EHR from MIMIC-IV**. The project integrates:

- **FHIR-compatible patient records**
- **Drools rulesets for baseline recommendations**
- **A/B testing vs. GenAI inference**
- **Fairness audits by gender, race, and age**
- **Explainability via SHAP visualizations**
- **HIPAA-aware architecture with full transparency**

> All modules use structured JSON inputs and simulate real CDS workflows with SHAP-based explainability and transparent documentation inspired by model card best practices.
